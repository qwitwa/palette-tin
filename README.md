# PaletteTin

This fork of [palette tin](https://github.com/josepablo-espinoza/palette-tin) streamlines the UX a little bit, and
massages the code to remove the reliance on a special value of gray to indicate the absense of color, instead allowing None as a color value. 

The foreground color previewer, scratchpad, and ability to hide is gone. The mix slider has been moved below the palette and made horizontal,
and the UX has been tweaked as the help text explains:

>            Ellipse/Rectangle/Cross represent Locked/Modifiable/Empty.
>
>            Left click to select a color.
>            Middle click to toggle locking.
>            Right click to mix.
>
>            The eraser icon button can be toggled; when on,
>            left and right click deletes. Middle click will
>            quit erase mode without having to click the button again.
>
>            Alternatively, you can always delete with Shift + Right click.
